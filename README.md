# EnterpriseResourcePlanningSystem

### **Enterprise Resource Planning System (Simplified ERP)**

The goal of this project is to create a simplified ERP system to manage various business modules such as employees, clients, sales, inventory, and finances. This project will allow you to dive into all the essential concepts of **Spring Boot**, including security, RESTful API management, data persistence, transaction management, testing, and even microservices if needed.

#### **Project Features:**

1. **Employee Management**  
   - Full CRUD operations for employees (create, read, update, delete).
   - Assign roles (administrator, employee, manager).
   - Use **Spring Security** with JWT for authentication and authorization.

2. **Client Management**  
   - Add and manage client information (profile, purchase history, VIP status, etc.).
   - Implement advanced search by name, ID, or category.

3. **Sales and Orders Management**  
   - Track orders, generate invoices, and handle payments.
   - Use **Spring Data JPA** and **Hibernate** to manage database entities.
   - Implement transaction management to ensure data integrity (e.g., confirming an order only when the payment is validated).

4. **Inventory Management**  
   - Manage products (add, update, delete, and view).
   - Track stock levels and send alerts when stock is low.
   - Integrate a file storage service (like **AWS S3** or local storage) for product images.

5. **Financial Dashboard**  
   - Track revenue, expenses, and profits.
   - Generate reports with charts to visualize performance (using **Thymeleaf** or **React** for the frontend).

6. **User Management and Security**  
   - Manage user roles and permissions with **Spring Security**.
   - Integrate **JWT** to secure REST APIs.
   - Implement a user management system where each user has specific permissions based on their role (admin, employee, etc.).

7. **Notifications and Emails**  
   - Automatically send email notifications for events like order confirmations, stock reminders, etc.
   - Use **Spring Boot Mail** to handle email services.

8. **RESTful APIs**  
   - Create RESTful APIs for each module (employees, clients, orders, etc.).
   - Document the APIs using **Swagger** or **Springdoc OpenAPI**.

9. **Caching and Optimization**  
   - Use **Spring Cache** to optimize frequently used queries (e.g., caching search results for clients or products).
   - Implement **Paging and Sorting** for large lists of items (clients, orders, etc.).

10. **Relational Database**  
   - Use **Spring Data JPA** with **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** for data management.
   - Map relationships between entities (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) using **Hibernate**.
   - Manage database migrations with **Flyway** or **Liquibase**.

11. **Unit and Integration Testing**  
   - Write unit tests using **JUnit** and **Mockito** for each layer of the project.
   - Perform integration testing for APIs using **Spring Test** (MockMvc) and **Testcontainers** for the database.

12. **CI/CD and DevOps**  
   - Set up continuous integration with **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI**.
   - Use **Docker** to containerize the Spring Boot application.
   - Deploy the application on a cloud service (such as **AWS**, **Heroku**, or **Google Cloud**).

#### **Spring Boot Concepts Covered:**
- **Spring Boot Core**: Auto-configuration, quick application startup.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Database access and management with Hibernate.
- **Spring Security**: Authentication, authorization, role management, JWT integration.
- **Spring REST**: Building and consuming RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Mail**: Sending email notifications.
- **Spring Cache**: Performance optimization using caching.
- **Spring Test**: Unit and integration testing.
- **Microservices (optional)**: Break down the application into multiple distinct services, each being a separate Spring Boot application.

### **Technical Stack:**
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Hibernate, JWT.
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend** (optional): Thymeleaf, React, or Angular.
- **CI/CD**: Docker, Jenkins/GitLab CI.
- **Cloud**: AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud.

This project will give you hands-on experience with advanced Spring Boot features while simulating real-world enterprise scenarios.
